				<p>Aurora v4 is the latest version of the Aurora Interpreter

				1-3 of the Aurora interpreter, the primary focus of v4 was 
				allowing Aurora to generate completely dynamic responses from 
				the source material she was provided in order to simulate how 
				real people talk in conversation. Like older versions of the 
				Aurora Interpreter, the v4 interpreter is not limited to any one 
				platform. The majority of the source material Aurora's 
				language skills are built on has been provided by my own 
				personal group chat with a few friends, and over the past 5 years, 
				Aurora has picked up on how we speak and has generated numerous 
				realistic (and often comical) responses to our conversations.</p>
				<p>If you would like to see a demonstration of Aurora v4, feel free to click the link below. 
				If you still want more info on how Aurora v4 works, you can 
				watch the more in-depth video I made on Aurora's backend, which is

				<h2><a name="baas"></a>Bass as a Service (2024)</h2>
				<p>The tech industry has made many life-changing, world-shifting innovations in my lifetime - but it is also known
				for a considerable number of inventions that nobody has ever asked for or needed. The past 15 years have also seen 
				far more applications adopt a service model even when such a model is totally unnecessary and consumer-unfriendly 
				for the product at hand. One day, for no good reason, I thought of something that I found absolutely hilarious and 
				sent it to my friend:
				<br/><br/>
				"OK hear me out: We get n big mouth billy bass, mount all of them to a wall somewhere, get cameras on all of them. Then, we build an enterprise bass management solution that lets us sell access to fish using an hourly pricing model similar to VPS compute pricing models. Users can dynamically scale their bass allocation, etc. All of their connected bass are accessible through a web portal where they can submit whatever jobs they want to the bass (which, in addition to being able to speak whatever they want, are also just fully functional computers that can run arbitrary jobs, optionally sending their command line output to the mouth to be read)
Nobody has even THOUGHT of migrating away from on-prem bass before but it'd be so cost effective"
					<br/><br/>
					This *should* have remained nothing more than a one-off joke in my DMs, but because I am an engineer and can't help myself, it did not:

				<h2><a name="frisbeedog"></a>Frisbee Dog VR (2023)</h2>
				<p>Frisbee Dog VR is a virtual reality frisbee dog game for the Oculus Quest I made with my friend <a href="https://reece.ooo/" target="_blank">Reece Jones</a> for our VR/AR course at Purdue University. In this game,
					the player is given a frisbee that they need to throw into a dynamically positioned target for their dog to catch. The style of our game is inspired by other frisbee dog video games I played as a kid. To make our game more 
					challenging than other frisbee dog games, we made sure that the user has full range and control over their disc trajectory in a way that more accurately approximates real-world flying disc movement. This means the user has to 
					ensure that the disc arrives in the target at the right time so the dog is able to catch it, as opposed to having the disc's final position as the only determiner of success. Currently, Frisbee Dog VR is more of a prototype 
					than a full game, but we may consider adding more stages/objectives and releasing it as a complete game if there is public interest.
					<br/><br/>
					Special thanks to my dog, Tyson for inspiring this idea and eagerly helping me with "field research" for this project.

				<h2><a name="stage"></a>Late to the Stage (2021)</h2>
				<p>Late to the Stage is my group's project for CS 307 (Software Engineering I) at Purdue University. Late to the Stage is an arena-style multiplayer game where users can select from a variety of avatars and 
				vehicles that they can pit against each other in a series of fast-paced minigames. Every match in Late to the Stage consists of (in no particular order) a battle royale round, a racing round, a demolition 
				derby round, and a round of "Confusing Captcha," a fun gamemode we added to make sure you aren't a robot. Although all of us had some level of involvement in every aspect of the development process, the 
				parts I focused the most on were the base game mechanics for Confusing Captcha and Demolition Derby, *many* bug fixes, captcha question design, and map design. This project would not have been 
				possible without my groupmates: Parker Lawrence, Lenny Meng, Evan Dunning, Chen Kai Chaung, and William Newton. After the course ended, my group and I decided to open-source our game's codebase in the hope 
				that it might help other game developers who want to familiarize themselves with the Godot engine.

				<p>Water You Using is my group's project for BoilerMake VII at Purdue University that provides users with the ability to precisely and effectively analyze their water consumption trends over time. Water You Using uses a network of custom-programmed water sensors that can be integrated directly into a building's water conduits to accurately measure the water usage of any of its faucets, showers, toilets, and other fixtures over time. Through our robust web application, users can learn more about which of their fixtures use the most water and when their peak water-usage times are - two very useful resources in determining how to save water. I was responsible for developing the backend and managing how data would be stored, queried, and returned to the users and the sensor network. This project wouldn't have been possible without my teammates: Levi, who developed the entire sensor assembly, and Sabrina and Kai, who both developed the entire frontend.
				
				Water You Using was also selected for the "Best Water Conservation Hack" award by EcoLab.</p>

				<h2><a name="midi"></a>MIDI Augmentation Program (2020)</h2>
				<p>This semester, as a part of my main programming course at 
				Purdue, CS 240, our final assignment was a multi-week long

				program complete with a parser, augmenter, and library in C 
				using GTK for the UI. Through my program, users can load in a 
				directory as a midi "library" and select any of the loaded midi 
				files from the sidebar to alter. Once a file is selected, the 
				user can manipulate the file in various different ways, such as 
				by changing the tempo, pitch, or instrument mapping of the 
				loaded song. Unfortunately, I cannot share the binary or source 
				for this program since the CS department has instructed us not 
				to do so, but you can click to the right to see a screenshot of

				have her call somebody by saying "Aurora, call Mitchell 
				Augustin, mobile." Not only does Aurora offer great assistance 
				to you by performing system tasks on command, but she can also 
				answer questions on many topics! For example, you could ask 
				Aurora about the height of Mt. Everest, what the chemical 
				formula of water is, what the square root of 100 is, and much, 
				much more. Aurora is also great at finding restaurants based on 
				your preferences. With help from Yelp, Aurora can find and show 
				information on many restaurants in your area. </p>

				<h2><a name="scorebert"></a>ScoreBert for Discord (2017 - present)</h2>
				<p>ScoreBert is a scoreboard for your Discord server that I made 
				in a few hours. Each member gets 10 points each month to give to other members whenever they do something cool. Compete with your friends to see who will rank highest on the scoreboard! 
				To use ScoreBert, just click the link below to add it to your 
				server. Simply send the "!help" command for the full command and 
				syntax list. If my version of ScoreBert doesn't work for you, 
				you are welcome to modify the source code below. You can also 
				host your own instance of ScoreBert by obtaining a bot token, 
				downloading the linked jar file, and running "java -jar 
				ScoreBert.jar [token]" with your token. Be aware that ScoreBert 
				automatically generates a SQL database called scores.db that 
				will contain all scoreboard information.<br />

				Unfortunately, I have decided to shut down Sonar. You can read my shutdown announcement below.
