				<h2>Annual Update - January 2, 2025</h2>
				2024 was an exciting year! I'm happy to say that my first year at Canonical was just as exciting and
				insightful as I had hoped it would be (and honestly even more than I expected, in many areas). In addition 
				to the type of work that I had expected to be doing, like Linux kernel debugging and testing, my work has 
				also involved a ton of other areas of operating system development that have been super fun to become more 
				acquainted with. On top of all that, I have also become something of a de-facto lab maintainer for our team's 
				server lab, which has been great for bolstering my infrastructure management/maintenance skills in addition 
				to my operating system software engineering work. Between that added bonus, the kernel bugs I've been finding 
				and fixing, the integration I'm working on for various userspace applications, and the higher-level architecting 
				I've been doing for some other things I'm hoping to integrate, I'm very satisfied with everything that was accomplished 
				this year and I'm looking forward to continuing my work on Ubuntu in 2025.
				<br />
				<br />
				One thing that I'm working on as an Ubuntu community effort (as a side project, not in any official capacity for
				Canonical, to be clear) is improving our integration of 
				hardware control interfaces for laptops. One thing that I have found as an Ubuntu Desktop user is that things like 
				controlling my laptop's keyboard macros, RGB lighting, and fan speeds often require third party software. Make no 
				mistake, this is true of Windows as well - but from the user's point of view, these applications like Armory Crate 
				typically come preinstalled with their machines. To be clear, default automatic pre-installation of these applications
				is not my goal here; however, ease of access to these hardware control 
				programs for users who want to install them certainly is something that would benefit our users. Today, much of this
				software is readily available, but not pre-built for Ubuntu/Debian and requires building from source, which is a
				hindrance for non-developers. My plan for the coming year is to spend some time packaging and distributing these 
				applications for Ubuntu, starting with asusctl. If you are running Ubuntu Oracular or newer on a supported Asus ROG
				or TUF notebook and would like to test my preview of pre-built asusctl, you can do so <a href="asusctl.html">here</a>. I have some additional ideas 
				for how to make these apps even easier for our users to consume, but I plan to cross that bridge once I have more apps 
				like asusctl fully packaged and readily available in Ubuntu. More to come soon!
				<br />
				<br />
				Outside of my Ubuntu work, I also spent some of my free time working on two side projects this year (*purely* for fun,
				in these cases). The first was Equle, my equation-based daily game (which you can read more about <a href="projects.html#equle">here</a>). The second 
				is much more... unconventional. More info on that one <a href="projects.html#baas">here</a>.

				<h2>Graduation and Career Update - January 4, 2024</h2>
				I'm excited to make two announcements today. First, I recently graduated from Purdue with my Master's degree in Computer Science.
				My work on Xinu over the past year has been very rewarding and has helped me significantly improve my operating system software development skills, as has my coursework.
				Second, I have accepted a full-time job offer from Canonical, where I will be joining the Ubuntu engineering team and working directly with major silicon vendors to optimize Ubuntu
				for their hardware. I am elated to have the opportunity to work full-time on improving Ubuntu and the Linux ecosystem as a whole, which I believe is integral to my philosophical
				career goal of improving computing for all users.

				<h2>School, work, and project updates - February 27, 2022</h2>

                Purdue's BS/MS program. However, I have still had some time to work on Spiral. Last month,
                I introduced several new features that had been requested by some of Spiral's users,
                such as support for exporting pages as PDFs, printing, and theme overrides, as well as a few
                notable usability improvements. Spiral is also now available for download <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spiral-notebook-bin" target="_blank">via the AUR</a>
                 (in addition to its <a href="spiral/index.html" target="_blank">project website</a>).<br />
                I am also excited to announce that I have accepted an internship offer with GE Aviation for this summer. 
                I look forward to learning more about the software development process in the aerospace industry, 
                which I think will be a fun experience.<br />

				<h2>Spiral Release and Summer Internship - October 15, 2020</h2>
				As usual, I have been very busy with my Computer Science 
				coursework since the start of the semester back in August, but 
				I'm excited to announce a couple of things regarding Spiral as well 
				as my career plans for next summer. First and foremost, although 
				Spiral has technically been released since June 22, when I 
				published version release 1.0 to the Spiral project page, I 
				decided to wait to make an announcement about it until I had a 
				sufficient amount of real-world notetaking experience with it 
				outside of the context of a testing environment. Given that I 
				have been using Spiral as my primary notetaking apparatus for 
				four different courses since the beginning of the semester, I 
				can confidently say that it has increased my productivity 
				considerably and allowed me to organize my notes more 
				effectively than traditional word processors, just as I had 
				intended. If you would like to try the first official release 
				version of Spiral, you can download it on <a href="spiral/index.html" target="_blank">Spiral's project website</a><br />
				<br />
				Second, after a solid set of interviews with several different 
				companies, I have decided to accept an offer to join Cat 
				Digital's Software Engineering internship program for Summer 
				2021. I look forward to working with Caterpillar and developing large-scale software 
				solutions, which is something 
				that I haven't had the opportunity to do yet as an individual 
				developer.<br />

				<h2>Spiral's first official beta release and native overhaul is 
				now available! - May 21, 2020</h2>
				It has been a very busy few months since the beginning of my 
				second semester at Purdue, but I'm happy to report that I'm 
				still doing well, I have had a great semester, and I have a 
				major Spiral update available for download. I'll start with 
				the Spiral update first since that's the primary reason for this 
				update. Over the past few months (but mostly during the past few 
				weeks since I was pretty busy with schoolwork up until May 9th), 
				I've been working to drastically improve Spiral's user 
				experience since it has become <em>my</em> primary note-taking 
				application. There were some pretty egregious usability and 
				efficiency issues that I ran into over a semester of using the 
				Java version, and it got to a point where I realized that if I 
				wanted Spiral to be good, I was going to have to start from 
				scratch and develop a native solution. As a result, that's 
				exactly what I did. Spiral Beta 1.0 - the first native release 
				of Spiral - is now available on <a href="spiral/index.html">
				Spiral's project website</a>. This version is considerably 
				snappier, cleaner, and has a much better file specification than 
				Spiral's alpha versions (notebooks are all contained in their 
				own individual files rather than with the "exploded" structure 
				of the alpha versions). It also contains several features 
				that would have been much more difficult to implement in the 
				Java version, such as system theming. This version of Spiral is 
				built on the QT framework, which has been a pleasure to develop 
				with. (Seriously, if you're going to make a desktop application, 
				QT is incredible). So far, I haven't noticed any major bugs on 
				either the Linux or Windows builds of Spiral on my personal 
				machines, but I will definitely be updating it throughout the 
				summer in order to fix any bugs I find and add more features.<br />
				<br />
				Aside from Spiral, I also participated in BoilerMake VII back in 
				January, where my teammates and I won the "Best Water 
				Conservation Hack" award by EcoLab for our water usage tracker, 
				"<a href="projects.html#water">Water You Using</a>."</td>

				<h2>Spiral's first alpha preview is available! (and other updates) - November 7, 2019</h2>
				Once again, I've neglected to update this home page for over a year, but I promise it isn't without reason.
				First and foremost, I have been spending the last few months working on my latest personal project, Spiral,
				which is finally available as an alpha preview. Spiral is a free-form note-taking application that lets users
				easily organize their thoughts without being effectively restricted to a linear document format like how most
				traditional word processors and note-taking apps function. I've been prioritizing Spiral over many of my other
				projects because I have been wanting to switch to Linux as my primary desktop OS for a long time, but a certain
				note-taking program isn't available on any Linux distributions, and I wasn't able to find an open-source alternative
				that had the features I was looking for. Obviously, the only solution was to write one myself. Although I didn't initially
				plan to release it to the public, I realized that there are probably tens of other people out there who would like a
				(non-web-based) version of this type of program, so here it is. You can download the first Alpha Preview build of Spiral
				on <a href="spiral/index.html" target="_blank">Spiral's project website</a>. Please do note that this is a preview build, so things are still buggy. Additionally, I have
				made Spiral open-source, so anyone is welcome to <a href="spiral/contribute.html" target="_blank">contribute</a>. Aside from Spiral, I have also been working on some major
				improvements to a few of my older projects, so be on the lookout for those in the next few months.
				<br>
                <br>
				On another note, I also started my first year as a Computer Science student at Purdue University back in August, so that has been occupying
				much of my time as well. (Thank you, Purdue Math Department).

				<h2>Where have I been? Summer Updates and new apps - July 15, 
				2018</h2>
				It's been almost a year since I've posted here, so I have quite 
				a bit to talk about in this post. Once Summer began, I 
				immediately got to work on a couple projects that I hadn't had 
				time to work on during my Junior year of high school as well as 
				a new project that I think is going to be very valuable. First 
				of all, I pushed out a few huge updates to LandmARk that really 
				improved its feature set and user experience with a brand new 
				Landmark editor and a new motion tracking system that I have 
				been writing over the past few months.
				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mitchellaugustin.landmark.android" target="_blank">
				Click here to try it out if you haven't already.</a> In addition 
				to the updates I have made to LandmARk, I have also been 
				spending a fairly large amount of time on a project that I 
				haven't announced until now to the public, Aurora v4. You can 
				find out more about that on the <a href="projects.html#aurorav4">
				projects page</a>. Finally, I have also been developing a school 
				safety app called Lockdown Manager which will hopefully allow 
				students and staff members to lower their response time in the 
				event of a hostile intruder. I don't have a release date planned 
				for Lockdown Manager yet, but the prototype is complete and I'm 
				working with my school district to get it implemented and 
				released to the public as soon as possible. Feel free to read

				<p>Once again, it has been a while since I have released a new

				passive recognition. That's right, you do not even have to lift 
				a finger to activate Aurora anymore. Simply enable "Hey, Aurora" 
				in the settings menu, and Aurora will begin listening whenever

				<h2>Aurora's new interpreter is here - August 31, 2015</h2>
				<p>I know it has been a while since the last update, but I can 
				guarantee that this update will fix many issues that you may 
				have encountered so far with Aurora. One thing that you will 
				notice immediately is that Aurora's voice recognition service is 
				different, as the Google speech dialog has been removed. This is 
				because I have reconfigured the voice recognition program to 
				work within the Aurora activity instead of launching its own. As 
				a result of this, you will notice that the voice recognition 
				service is more efficient than it was before. Additionally, you 
				will also see that the speak button will turn red while you are 
				speaking to Aurora, and your speech will be constantly updated 
				on the screen as you speak. However, these are not the only 
				updates. In addition to everything already listed, I have also 
				updated Aurora's interpreter program to be more dynamic and 
				understand a wider range of conversation. You may notice that 
				Aurora can't understand as much outside of commands that she 
				used to, but I can assure you that this is only temporary. I 
				have created this new interpreter so that conversational topics 
				can be easily added, so you will find that Aurora's 
				conversational skills will really begin to improve after this 
				update. One other thing that you may notice is that Aurora will 
				send you to the Google client for text messages and some 
				calling. Again, this is only temporary. I will be implementing 
				my own client program for this in the next update.</p>

				<h2>Aurora Interpreter v2 - August 15, 2015</h2>
				<p>Get ready for a huge improvement to Aurora's conversation 
				with Aurora Interpreter v2! It still won't be out for a while, 
				but the newly redesigned Aurora program will drastically change 
				how you use your personal assistant. The issue with most 
				personal assistants is that they do not usually give you a 
				response that corresponds directly to your question. For example, 
				if you say "I like [insert word here]," most virtual assistants 
				would just respond with something generic like "I don't know 
				much about that." However, once the new interpreter is released, 
				you will be able to say something to Aurora and get an 
				informational response that is exclusive to whatever you said. 
				For example, you could say something like "I like pasta," and 
				Aurora could respond with some information on the nutritional 
				facts of pasta, or even locations of nearby pasta restaurants.</p>

				<h2>Aurora Beta 2.0: The biggest update yet - July 29, 2015</h2>
				<p>The latest update of Aurora (Beta 2.0) would have to be, at 
				least in my opinion, the biggest update yet. Not only does this 
				update fix many bugs that have been brought to my attention by 
				the users, but it also adds a plethora of new features that 
				improve the overall user experience. What are these features, 
				you may ask? My personal favorite feature is the new user 
				preference database. Simply put, Aurora can now remember key 
				details about things you say to her. Currently it is limited to 
				favorite foods, but the database is growing. Don't worry though, 
				since the database is entirely at device level, no outside 
				servers can access your information. (Not including searches on 
				Yelp, Google, or Wolfram|Alpha) In addition to the restaurant 
				recommendations, Aurora is also able to search the Wolfram|Alpha 
				database for answers to questions that she does not know the 
				answer to. Another function that I recently added is Aurora's 
				spell command. Simply say "Spell" followed by a word and Aurora 
				will speak the spelling of that word to you.</p>

				have been added, but I am certain that Aurora's new look is a much 
				better alternative than the previous. One of the biggest changes 
				that you will notice is Aurora's new action bar. From the action 
				bar, users can access the command list and settings menu by 
				pressing their respective buttons. Also, the new settings menu 
				allows the user to physically edit their preferences in addition 
				to the voice options. There were also several bug fixes, some of 
				which include improvements with temperature conversions and a 
				fix to the frequent screen freezing.</p>

				have also added two huge features to Aurora's code. One of those 
				features could save some time, or possibly convenience a person 
				while driving. Now, by simply saying "Aurora, get most recent 
				text message," Aurora will read the most recent sms message sent 
				to the user's phone! The other feature that I have added is a 
				location feature. By saying "Where am I?" to Aurora, the user 
				can get a voice response of their current street address. I 
				personally think that this is my favorite feature yet, but if 
				you do not like it, you can simply disable Aurora's location 
				access in your device's settings menu.</p>
