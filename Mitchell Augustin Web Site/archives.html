				help with it. When a user had virtual passenger installed, it 
				would monitor the phone's speed using its GPS and linear 
				acceleration sensors. As soon as the speed goes above the 30 MPH 
				threshold, the phone would display a system notification which 
				prompted the user to put down their phone if they were driving. 
				Unfortunately, I was unable to interest enough users in this 
				app, so I have since removed it from the Play Store.</p>

				<p>Although I never published a full game, I became very 
				familiar with two different 3D game engines. When I first 
				decided to start programming, I planned on being a game 
				developer. After I got tired of developing mobile games, I started out by learning how to write my own 
				(extremely basic) game engine for desktops. However, when I realized that I 
				would be better off using an established engine, I began 
				learning about an engine called JMonkey. I went on to create a 
				very minimal game environment in JMonkey, which allowed me to 
				master the fundamental elements of the engine. After realizing 
				the negatives of using a Java-based engine for game development, 
				I went on to learn about Unreal Engine later on.</p>

				"Plecostoman and the Search for the Mystical Algae Wafer." I 
				wrote the first version of this game in Java, where it amassed 
				roughly 1300 lines of code. (Quite a bit for 10-year-old me.) 
				Plecostoman was a text-based adventure game in the style of old 
				DOS games like Zork, in which you play as a Plecostomus who has 
				to travel the Amazon River in search of the Mystical Algae 
				Wafer. Later on, I ported Plecostoman to Android. This was the 
				first Android app that I made entirely on my own without any 
				help from tutorials. In 2012, I also created a sequel to 
				Plecostoman called "Plecostoman 2: Attack on the cucumbers."</p>

				<h2><a name="schweb"></a>Schweb (2007-2012)</h2>
				<p>Throughout my time in elementary and middle school, I ran 
				several websites under the name "Schweb." Initially, Schweb 
				started as my own personal review website. It was a place where 
				I could talk about whatever I was into. Schweb ran under the URL 
				schweb.homestead.com until 2010, which is when I decided to 
				change things around and expand into a new area of development. 
				Around this time, I was just beginning to learn how to make 
				games, so I decided that it would be a good idea to showcase 
				them on my website. From this moment on, Schweb had been split 
				into two separate sites - Schweb Reviews and Schweb Games. In 
				2011, I added a social network to the mix. Schweb Social was my 
				first attempt at creating a social network. Unfortunately, its 
				capabilities were very limited, and it only gained 2 other users 
				in its lifespan, both of which were my best friends. In 2012, I 
				decided to shut down all of Schweb's websites permanently in 
				order to focus more on my other projects.</p>

				<h2><a name="incomplete"></a>Various viruses and joke programs</h2>
				<p>I also like to make little "viruses" in my spare time to 
				prank my friends with. None of them do any actual damage to 
				computers, but a few of them can hide themselves pretty well. 
				I've only ever tested them on my computer and my friends' 
				computers (with their permission, of course). I don't have these 
				programs publicly accessible for obvious reasons, but here are a 
				few brief descriptions of some of my favorites.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The Star Trek Shutdown virus, a program that would 
					install itself into the user's startup directory and begin 
					playing the Star Trek red alert siren along with a countdown 
					timer. After five minutes, the computer would shut down and 
					the process would begin on restart. Don't worry, I also 
					wrote a batch file that reverses the effect.</li>
					<li>warmitup.exe, a gag program based on
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbepN4dKLbU" target="_blank">this 
					video</a> that displays a moving gif of a tongue and plays 
					sound clips from the video.</li>
					<li>Barrel roll, a script that constantly rotates your 
					screen</li>
					<li>A program that constantly opens and closes your disk 
					drive</li>
					<li>A program that force-closes all of your programs and 
					kills explorer.exe repeatedly (Also blue-screens devices 
					running an OS older than Windows 7)</li>

					function as a door lock (2015)<ol style="list-style:circle">
						<li>Aborted due to lack of funds and receiving faulty 
						hardware</li>

					<li>PlecOS, a Linux distro that I was going to make for fun

						<li>Aborted because I didn't have any practical need for 
						a new OS, and my computer at the time was incapable of

					<li>Humanization mod for Minecraft, a mod that would add 
					various extra living necessities to the game, such as using 
					the bathroom, clothing, temperature requirements, thirst, 
					etc. (2015)<ol style="list-style:circle">
						<li>Aborted because I needed to focus more on the 
						development of Aurora for Home Automation</li>

					<li>An unnamed social network project that would operate 
					entirely through proxies to circumvent network restrictions<ol style="list-style:circle">
						<li>Aborted due to a general lack of interest, and
